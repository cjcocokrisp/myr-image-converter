This program is meant convert images to be viewed in the MYR VR platform.

MYR is a VR sandbox developed by Fred Martin's research lab at University of Massachusetts Lowell.
https://learnmyr.org

There are two scripts apart of this project, convert.py and resize.py. 
convert.py will convert the image to MYR code and then output it to a text file in the output folder.
resize.py will resize an image based on the percentage that you give.

Important Note: Some images may be too large to be rendered in a good amount of time in MYR so use
the resize script to make it smaller and render faster. 

----------------------------------------------PREREQUISITES---------------------------------------------------------

Python is required to use these scripts and the Python Image Library is needed. Specifically python3 or above.
Pillow is required to use these scripts and is used to render the images.
